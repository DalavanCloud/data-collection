# Data Collection

Log data provides critical insights into software systems. However, in the age of ubiquitous computing, unifying logs from hundreds of data sources with different data formats presents a big challenge. [Fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org) is an open source data collector that solves this problem by providing an unified logging layer with a pluggable and reliable architecture.
